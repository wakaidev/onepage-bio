				<p>
					I have over 2 years of experience as a software engineer, and have
					worked at small startups and worked on numerous personal projects.
					While I'm a proficient full-stack developer, I love learning new
					technologies and communicating new ideas.
				</p>
				<p>
					I love building things. When I was young I spent a lot a time breaking
					and rebuilding computers. While hard engineering problems are often
					intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real
					customer problems with a business justification. I'm looking for a
					senior individual contributor role where I can take on on
					collaborative team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience
					with architecture and project management.
